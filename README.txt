Hello there! Thank you for choosing RetroGamePackage as your 
school games provider. Here are some instructions on how to 
set up, play, and even expand your games. The following will 
go through individual procedures for each type of game. I 
hope you enjoy your experience with RetroGamePackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------

To play any game, simply open the RGP Navigator and let it 
guide you through choosing a game. The first time you try to
run a game for each console, you will need to choose what app
to open that filetype with. All you need to do on these initial
occassions is scroll down and click "Look for an app on this PC"
and navigate to the corresponding emulator shortcut (they will 
be in the same folder as the navigator program.)
If you don't know what the acronyms used in the Navigator mean, 
refer to the key below:

NES: Nintendo Entertainment System (1985)
GBA: GameBoy Advance (2001)
GBC: GameBoy Color (1998)
N64: Nintendo 64 (1996)

DISCLAIMER: For programs to work at school, do not remove them 
from your OneDrive folder.
