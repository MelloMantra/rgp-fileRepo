Hello there! Thank you for choosing RetroGamePackage as your 
school games provider. Here are some instructions on how to 
set up, play, and even expand your games. The following will 
go through individual procedures for each type of game. I 
hope you enjoy your experience with RetroGamePackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------

GAMEBOY GAMES:
To open a GameBoy/GameBoy Color/GameBoy Advance game, you 
must double-click the game file, and if it's your first time 
running this type game, you will be prompted to select an app 
to open it with. To open the game, click "Find an App on This 
PC" and navigate to the BGB emulator. Now you'll want to 
check the "Always open these types of files with BGB" 
checkbox to reduce the number of times you have to go through 
this step.

NES GAMES:
To open an NES game, you must open the game files using the 
FCEUX emulator. Just use the "Open with..." function used for 
the GameBoy games.

N64 & WII GAMES:
Drag and drop the game files into Dolphin while it's open to 
add them to your Dolphin library. You will only need to do 
this once. Simply open the emulator again to access your games.

DISCLAIMER: Some programs and/or emulators are only compatible 
with Windows. For them to work at school, do not remove them 
from your OneDrive folder.
