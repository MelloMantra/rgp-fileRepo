FAQ:


Q: What do I do when it asks me what app to open a game with?

A: Click "Look for app on this PC" and go into the Starter_Pack folder, 
   where you'll find the three emulators you need to open any game. Note: 
   Arcade games also use the NES emulator.



Q: What do these acronyms stand for?

A: GB = GameBoy, NES = Nintendo Entertainment System, N64 = Nintendo 64

Games opening in wrong emulator (consistently):

Go to Contents>library>(game types that are opening in wrong emulator) and 
right click one of the games. Then, select Open with... and choose the correct 
emulator. Make sure that when you do this, the box saying 
"Always open .(extension) files with this application" is checked.


Games not opening at all:

Make sure that you only have one RGP Navigator window open, and that it 
is not maximized.
